# WP Boilerplate

## Getting Started

With a local instance of WordPress and Timber installed, it's easy to get started.

Install dependencies with `yarn`

Use `yarn build` to bundle js and css files and generate `build` folder using Webpack.

Run `yarn start` to initialize `browser-sync` via the `browser-sync-webpack-plugin` which will proxy your local WordPress instance and trigger a reload when Webpack updates.
